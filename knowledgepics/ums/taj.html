                                <p class="para1">The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in
                                    the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan (r. 1628–1658) to house
                                    the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. The tomb is the
                                    centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal
                                    gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who
                                    inhabited the region by the 10th century
                                    BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to
                                    1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for
                                    the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important center of commerce—especially silk, grain, and
                                    spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have
                                    been the first real international financial center, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest
                                    prominence in the 14th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. For
                                    centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving
                                    a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today. The sovereignty of
                                    Venice came to an end in 1797, in the hands of Napoleon. Subsequently, in 1866, the city become part of the
                                    Kingdom of Italy</p>
                            
                                <p class="para2">The Taj Mahal was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983 for being "the jewel of Muslim
                                    art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage". It is regarded by many as
                                    the best example of Mughal architecture and a symbol of India's rich history. The Taj Mahal attracts more than 6
                                    million visitors a year and in 2007, it was declared a winner of the New 7 Wonders of the World (2000–2007)

                                Its origins lie
                                in the moving circumstances of its commission and the culture and history of an Islamic Mughal empire's rule of
                                large parts of India. The distraught Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the project upon the death of one of
                                his favorite wives Mumtaz Mahal.
                        
                                Today it is one of the most famous and recognizable buildings in the world and while the large, domed marble
                                mausoleum is the most familiar part of the monument, the Taj Mahal is an extensive complex of buildings and
                                gardens that extends over 22.44 hectares (55.5 acres) and includes subsidiary tombs, waterworks
                                infrastructure, the small town of Taj Ganji to the south and a 'moonlight garden' to the north of the river.
                                Construction of Taj Mahal began in 1632 AD, (1041 AH), on the south bank of the River Yamuna in Agra, and was
                                substantially complete by 1648 AD (1058 AH). The design was conceived as an earthly replica of the house of
                                Mumtaz Mahal in paradise.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The Taj Mahal attracts a large number of tourists. UNESCO documented more than 2 million visitors
                                in 2001, which had increased to about 7–8 million in 2014. A two-tier pricing system is in place, with a
                                significantly lower entrance fee for Indian citizens and a more expensive one for foreigners. As of 2022, the
                                fee for Indian citizens was ₹50, for citizens of SAARC and BIMSTEC countries ₹540, for foreign tourists
                                ₹1,100. Most tourists visit in the cooler months of October, November and February. Polluting traffic is not
                                allowed near the complex and tourists must either walk from parking areas or catch an electric bus. The
                                Khawasspuras (northern courtyards) are currently being restored for use as a new visitor centre. In
                                2019, in order to address overtourism, the site instituted fines for visitors who stayed longer than three
                                hours.

                                The small town to the south of the Taj, known as Taj Ganji or Mumtazabad, was initially constructed with
                                caravanserais, bazaars and markets to serve the needs of visitors and workers. Lists of recommended travel
                                destinations often feature the Taj Mahal, which also appears in several listings of seven wonders of the modern
                                world, including the recently announced New Seven Wonders of the World, a recent poll with 100 million votes
