                                <p class="para1">The Dead Sea also
                                    known by other names, is a salt lake bordered by Jordan to the east and Israel and the West Bank to the west. It
                                    lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.
                            
                                    The lake's surface is 430.5 metres (1,412 ft) below sea level,making its shores the lowest land-based
                                    elevation on Earth. It is 304 m (997 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. With a salinity of 342
                                    g/kg, or 34.2% (in 2011), it is one of the world's saltiest bodies of water – 9.6 times as salty as the ocean
                                    – and has a density of 1.24 kg/litre, which makes swimming similar to floating. This salinity makes for a
                                    harsh environment in which plants and animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea's main, northern
                                    basin is 50 kilometres (31 mi) long and 15 kilometres (9 mi) wide at its widest point</p>
                            
                                <p class="para2">The Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean Basin for thousands of years. It
                                    was one of the world's first health resorts (for Herod the Great), and it has been the supplier of a wide
                                    variety of products, from asphalt for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilisers. Today, tourists visit
                                    the sea on its Israeli, Jordanian and West Bank coastlines. The Palestinian tourism industry has been met with
                                    setbacks in developing along the West Bank coast.
                            
                                    The Dead Sea is receding at a swift rate; its surface area today is 605 km2 (234 sq mi), having been 1,050 km2
                                    (410 sq mi) in 1930. The recession of the Dead Sea has begun causing problems,[vague] and multiple canal and
                                    pipeline proposals have been made to reduce its recession. One of these proposals is the Red Sea–Dead Sea Water
                                    Conveyance pipeline project,</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The Dead Sea is an endorheic lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by
                                the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary
                                between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the
                                northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai. It is here that the Upper Jordan
                                River/Sea of Galilee/Lower Jordan River water system comes to an end.
                        
                                The Jordan River is the only major water source flowing into the Dead Sea, although there are small perennial
                                springs under and around the Dead Sea, forming pools and quicksand pits along the edges. There are no outlet
                                streams.
                        
                                The Mujib River, biblical Arnon, is one of the larger water sources of the Dead Sea other than the Jordan.
                                The Wadi Mujib valley, 420 m below the sea level in the southern part of the Jordan valley, is a biosphere
                                reserve, with an area of 212 km2 (82 sq mi). Other more substantial sources are Wadi Darajeh (Arabic)/Nahal
                                Dragot (Hebrew), and Nahal Arugot [de] that ends at Ein Gedi. Wadi Hasa (biblical Zered) is another wadi
                                flowing into the Dead Sea.
                        
                                Rainfall is scarcely 100 mm (4 in) per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely 50 mm (2 in) in the
                                southern part. The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judaean Mountains. The
                                highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.
                        
                                To the west of the Dead Sea, the Judaean mountains rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to
                                the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m (700 ft) tall halite mineral formation called Mount
                                Sodom.</p>

                                in Antarctica (35%), Lake Assal in Djibouti (34.8%), Lagoon Garabogazköl in the Caspian Sea (up to 35%) and some
                                hypersaline ponds and lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond (44%)) have reported
                                higher salinities.
                        
                                In the 19th century and the early 20th century, the surface layers of the Dead Sea were less salty than today,
                                which resulted in an average density in the range of 1.15-1.17 g/cm3 instead of the present value of around 1.25
                                g/cm3. A sample tested by Bernays in the 19th century had a salinity of 19%. By the year 1926, the salinity had
                                increased  (although it was also suspected that the salinity varies seasonally and depends on the
                                distance from the mouth of the Jordan).
