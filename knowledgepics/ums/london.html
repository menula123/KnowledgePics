                                <p class="para1">London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom, with a population of just
                                    over 9 million. It stands on the River Thames in south-east England at the head of a 50-mile (80 km) estuary
                                    down to the North Sea, and has been a major settlement for two millennia. The City of London, its ancient
                                    core and financial centre, was founded by the Romans as Londinium and retains boundaries close to its medieval
                                    ones.Since the 19th century, the name "London" has also referred to the metropolis around this
                                    core, historically split between the counties of Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which
                                    largely comprises Greater London, governed by the Greater London Authority.[The City of
                                    Westminster, to the west of the City of London, has for centuries held the national government and parliament.
                            
                                </p>
                            
                                <p class="para2">As one of the world's major global cities, London exerts a strong influence on its arts,
                                    entertainment, fashion, commerce and finance, education, health care, media, science and technology, tourism,
                                    and transport and communications. Its GDP (€801.66 billion in 2017) makes it the biggest urban economy
                                    in Europe, and it is one of the major financial centres in the world. As of 2021, London had the most
                                    millionaires of any city. With Europe's largest concentration of higher education institutions,it
                                    includes Imperial College London in natural and applied sciences, the London School of Economics in social
                                    sciences, and the comprehensive University College London. London has the busiest city airport system in the
                                    world and the London Underground is the oldest rapid transit system in the world.London is one of the
                                    most-visited cities in the world and is home to the most 5-star hotels of any city.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The history of London, the capital city of England and the United Kingdom, extends over 2000 years.
                                In that time, it has become one of the world's most significant financial and cultural capital cities. It has
                                withstood plague, devastating fire, civil war, aerial bombardment, terrorist attacks, and riots.
                        
                                The City of London is the historic core of the Greater London metropolis, and is today its primary financial
                                district, though it represents only a small part of the wider metropolis
                        
                                Some recent discoveries indicate probable very early settlements near the Thames in the London area. In 1993,
                                the remains of a Bronze Age bridge were found on the Thames's south foreshore, upstream of Vauxhall Bridge.
                                This bridge either crossed the Thames or went to a now lost island in the river. Dendrology dated the timbers to
                                between 1750 BCE and 1285 BCE. In 2001, a further dig found that the timbers were driven vertically into the
                                ground on the south bank of the Thames west of Vauxhall Bridge.
                        
                                In 2010, the foundations of a large timber structure, dated to between 4800 BCE and 4500 BCE were found,
                                again on the foreshore south of Vauxhall Bridge.The function of the mesolithic structure is not known. All
                                these structures are on the south bank at a natural crossing point where the River Effra flows into the
                                Thames.
                        
                                Archaeologist Leslie Wallace notes, "Because no LPRIA [Late pre-Roman Iron Age] settlements or significant
                                domestic refuse have been found in London, despite extensive archaeological excavation, arguments for a purely
                                Roman foundation of London are now common and uncontroversial.</p>
