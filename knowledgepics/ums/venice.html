                                Venexia[citation needed] [veˈnɛsja]) is a city in northeastern Italy and the capital of the Veneto region. It is
                                built on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by over 400 bridges. The
                                islands are in the shallow Venetian Lagoon, an enclosed bay lying between the mouths of the Po and the Piave
                                rivers (more exactly between the Brenta and the Sile). In 2020, around 258,685 people resided in greater Venice
                                or the Comune di Venezia, of whom around 55,000 live in the historical island city of Venice (centro storico)
                                and the rest on the mainland (terraferma). Together with the cities of Padua and Treviso, Venice is included in
                                the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE), which is considered a statistical metropolitan area, with
                                a total population of 2.6 million <br><br> The name is derived from the ancient Veneti people who inhabited the region by the 10th century
                                BC. The city was historically the capital of the Republic of Venice for over a millennium, from 697 to
                                1797. It was a major financial and maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for
                                the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as an important center of commerce—especially silk, grain, and
                                spice, and of art from the 13th century to the end of the 17th. The city-state of Venice is considered to have
                                been the first real international financial center, emerging in the 9th century and reaching its greatest
                                prominence in the 14th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. For
                                centuries Venice possessed numerous territories along the Adriatic Sea and within the Italian peninsula, leaving
                                a significant impact on the architecture and culture that can still be seen today.[ The sovereignty of
                                Venice came to an end in 1797, in the hands of Napoleon. Subsequently, in 1866, the city become part of the
                                Kingdom of Italy</p>

                                known as the Most Serene Republic of Venice (Venetian: Serenìsima Repùblica Vèneta; Italian: Serenissima
                                Repubblica di Venezia), was a sovereign state and maritime republic in northeastern Italy, which existed for a
                                millennium between the 9th century and 1747.
                        
                                It was based in the lagoon communities of the historically prosperous city of Venice, and was a leading European
                                economic and trading power during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the most successful of Italy's maritime
                                republics. By the late Middle Ages, it held significant territories in the mainland of northern Italy, known as
                                the Domini di Terraferma, along with most of the Dalmatian coast on the other side of the Adriatic Sea, and
                                Crete and numerous small colonies around the Mediterranean Sea, together known as the Stato da Màr.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Venice is an important destination for tourists who want to see its celebrated art and
                                architecture. The city hosts up to 60,000 tourists per day (2017 estimate). Estimates of the annual number
                                of tourists vary from 22 million to 30 million. This "overtourism" creates overcrowding and
                                environmental problems for Venice's ecosystem. By 2017, UNESCO was considering the addition of Venice to its
                                "In-Danger" list, which includes historical ruins in war-torn countries. To reduce the number of visitors, who
                                are causing irreversible changes in Venice, the agency supports limiting the number of cruise ships as
                                well as implementing a strategy for more sustainable tourism.

                                Tourism has been a major part of the Venetian economy since the 18th century, when Venice—with its beautiful
                                cityscape, uniqueness, and rich musical and artistic cultural heritage—was a stop on the Grand Tour. In the 19th
                                century, Venice became a fashionable centre for the "rich and famous", who often stayed and dined at luxury
                                establishments such as the Danieli Hotel and the Caffè Florian, and continued to be a fashionable city into the
                                early 20th century. In the 1980s, the Carnival of Venice was revived; and the city has become a major
                                centre of international conferences and festivals, such as the prestigious Venice Biennale and the Venice Film
                                Festival, which attract visitors from all over the world for their theatrical, cultural, cinematic, artistic,
                                and musical productions</p>
