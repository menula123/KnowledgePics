                                <p class="para1">The Kandy Esala Perahera (the Sri Dalada Perahara procession of Kandy) also known as The Festival
                                    of the Tooth is a festival held in July and August in Kandy, Sri Lanka. This historical procession is held
                                    annually to pay homage to the Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha, which is housed at the Sri Dalada Maligawa in Kandy.
                                    A unique symbol of Sri Lanka, the procession consists of traditional local dances such as fire dances and
                                    performances in whip-dance garments. The festival ends with the traditional Diya-kepeema ritual, a water cutting
                                    ceremony which is held at the Mahaweli River at Getambe, Kandy.</p>
                            
                                   The Esala is believed[who?] to be a fusion of two separate but interconnected "Peraheras"
                                    (Processions) â€“ The Esala and Dalada. The Esala Perahera, which is thought to date back to the 3rd century BC,
                                    was a ritual enacted to request the gods for rainfall. The Dalada Perahera is believed to have begun when the
                                    Sacred Tooth Relic of the Buddha was brought to Sri Lanka from India during the 4th century CE, eight hundred
                                    years after the passing away of Buddha.
                            
                                    According to tradition, the Tooth Relic was taken in procession to Sri Lanka by Princess Hemamala & Prince
                                    Dantha.[citation needed]
                            
                                    It was also through the efforts of Upali Thera that the Kandy Esala Perahera came into being. This procession
                                    was originally focused on honor to Hindu deities, particularly those incorporated into Sri Lankan Buddhism.
                                    Upali Thera believed this to be inappropriate in a Buddhist nation, and his influence led to the king declaring
                                    that "Henceforth Gods and men are to follow the Buddha".</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The city and the region have been known by many different names and versions of those names. Some
                                scholars suggest that the original name of Kandy was Katubulu Nuwara located near the present Watapuluwa.
                                However, the more popular historical name is Senkadagala or Senkadagalapura, officially Senkadagala Siriwardhana
                                Maha Nuwara (meaning 'great city of Senkadagala of growing resplendence'), generally shortened to 'Maha Nuwara'.
                                According to folklore, this name originated from one of the several possible sources. One being the city was
                                named after a brahmin with the name Senkanda who lived in a cave nearby, and another being a queen of
                                Vikramabahu III was named Senkanda, and after a coloured stone named Senkadagala. The Kingdom of Kandy has also
                                been known by various names. The English name Kandy, which originated during the colonial era, is derived from
                                an anglicised version of the Sinhala Kanda Uda Rata (meaning the land on the mountain) or Kanda Uda Pas Rata
                                (the five counties/countries on the mountain). The Portuguese shortened this to "Candea", using the name for
                                both the kingdom and its capital. In Sinhala, Kandy is called Maha nuwara, meaning "Great City" or "The
                                Capital", although this is most often shortened to Nuwara</p>

                            <p class="card-text">Kandy, an important city, is located in the Central Province of Sri Lanka. The city of Kandy was
                                the last capital during the era of ancient kings in Sri Lanka. It is the now the administrative and religious
                                capital of the Central Province apart from being its capital. Kandy is situated in the middle of the hills in
                                the Kandy plateau which is surrounded by tea plantations. It is also home to one of the most sacred Buddhist
                                temples in the world, the Tooth Relic. In the year 1988, it was declared a world heritage site by UNESCO.
                                Tourism in Kandy is one of the essential things about the economy of Sri lanka.
