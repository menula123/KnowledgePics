                                <p class="para1">New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.
                                    It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and
                                    over 700 smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area, covering 268,021 square kilometres
                                    (103,500 sq mi). New Zealand is about 2,000 kilometres (1,200 mi) east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and
                                    1,000 kilometres (600 mi) south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied
                                    topography and sharp mountain peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic
                                    eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland.</p>
                            
                                <p class="para2">Owing to their remoteness, the islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable landmass to be
                                    settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then developed a
                                    distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first European to sight and record
                                    New Zealand, after which Dutch cartographers named the country Nova Zelandia, the Latin translation of the Dutch
                                    Nieuw Zeeland (after the Dutch province of Zeeland).[13] Exploratory voyages, mainly by British and French
                                    explorers, occurred in the late 18th century, with varied but mainly British trading and settlement occurring
                                    until 1840. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which
                                    in its English version declared</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The history of New Zealand (Aotearoa) dates back to between 1320 and 1350 CE, when the main
                                settlement period started, after it was discovered and settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori
                                culture. Like other Pacific cultures, Māori society was centred on kinship links and connection with the land
                                but, unlike them, it was adapted to a cool, temperate environment rather than a warm, tropical one.
                        
                                The first European explorer known to visit New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel Tasman on 13 December 1642.[1]
                                In 1643 he charted the west coast of the North Island, his expedition then sailed back to Batavia without
                                setting foot on New Zealand soil. British explorer James Cook, who reached New Zealand in October 1769 on the
                                first of his three voyages, was the first European to circumnavigate and map New Zealand.[2] From the late 18th
                                century, the country was regularly visited by explorers and other sailors, missionaries, traders and
                                adventurers.
                        
                                In 1840 the Treaty of Waitangi was signed between representatives of the United Kingdom and various Māori
                                chiefs, bringing New Zealand into the British Empire and giving Māori the same rights as British subjects.
                                Disputes over the differing translations of the Treaty and settler desire to acquire land from Māori led to the
                                New Zealand Wars from 1843. There was extensive British settlement throughout the rest of the 19th century and
                                into the early part of the next century. The effects of European infectious diseases,[3] the New Zealand Wars
                                and the imposition of a European economic and legal system led to most of New Zealand's land passing from Māori
                                to Pākehā (European) ownership, and Māori became impoverished.</p>
