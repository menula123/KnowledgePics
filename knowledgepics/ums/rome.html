                                <p class="para1">Rome Roma is the capital city of Italy. It is also the
                                    capital of the Lazio region, the centre of the Metropolitan City of Rome, and a special comune named Comune di
                                    Roma Capitale. With 2,860,009 residents in 1,285 km2 (496.1 sq mi), Rome is the country's most populated
                                    comune and the third most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan
                                    City of Rome, with a population of 4,355,725 residents, is the most populous metropolitan city in Italy. Its
                                    metropolitan area is the third-most populous within Italy. Rome is located in the central-western portion of
                                    the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. Vatican City (the smallest country
                                    in the world) is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a
                                    country within a city. Rome is often referred to as the City of Seven Hills due to its geographic location, and
                                    also as the "Eternal City". Rome is generally considered to be the "cradle of Western civilisation and
                                    Christian culture", and the centre of the Catholic Church.</p>
                            
                                <p class="para2">Rome's history spans 28 centuries. While Roman mythology dates the founding of Rome at around 753
                                    BC, the site has been inhabited for much longer, making it a major human settlement for almost three millennia
                                    and one of the oldest continuously occupied cities in Europe.The city's early population originated from a
                                    mix of Latins, Etruscans, and Sabines. Eventually, the city successively became the capital of the Roman
                                    Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire, and is regarded by many as the first-ever Imperial city and
                                    metropolis. It was first called The Eternal City by the
                                    Roman poet Tibullus in the 1st century BC, and the expression was also taken up by Ovid, Virgil, and
                                    Livy. Rome is also called "Caput Mundi" (Capital of the World). After the fall of the Empire in the
                                    west, which marked the beginning of the Middle Ages, Rome slowly fell under the political control of the Papacy,
                                    and in the 8th century, it became the capital of the Papal States, which lasted until 1870. Beginning with the
                                    Renaissance, almost all popes since Nicholas V (1447â€“1455) pursued a coherent architectural and urban programme
                                    over four hundred years, aimed at making the city the artistic and cultural centre of the world.</p>

                                Rome. Roman history has been influential on the modern world, especially in the history of the Catholic Church,
                                and Roman law has influenced many modern legal systems. Roman history can be divided into the following periods:
                        
                                here is archaeological evidence of human occupation of the Rome area from at least 5,000 years, but the dense
                                layer of much younger debris obscures Palaeolithic and Neolithic sites. The evidence suggesting the city's
                                ancient foundation is also obscured by the legend of Rome's beginning involving Romulus and Remus.
                        
                                The traditional date for the founding of Rome is 753-04-21 BC, following Marcus Terentius Varro, and the city
                                and surrounding region of Latium has continued to be inhabited with little interruption since around that time.
                                Excavations made in 2014 have revealed a wall built long before the city's official founding year.
                                Archaeologists uncovered a stone wall and pieces of pottery dating to the 9th century BC and the beginning of
                                the 8th century BC, and there is evidence of people arriving on the Palatine hill as early as the 10th century
                                BC.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">The architecture of Rome over the centuries has greatly developed from Ancient Roman architecture
                                to Italian modern and contemporary architecture. Rome was once the world's main epicentres of Classical
                                architecture, developing new forms such as the arch, the dome and the vault. The Romanesque style in the 11th,
                                12th and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main
                                centres of Renaissance and Baroque architecture. Rome's cityscape is also widely Neoclassical and Fascist in
                                style.
                                <br><br>
                                During the Roman Republic, most Roman buildings were made of concrete and bricks, but ever since about 100 BC
                                and the Roman Empire, marble and gold were more widely used as decoration themes in the architecture of Rome,
                                especially in temples, palaces, fora and public buildings in general. Most buildings, just like in Classical
                                Athens, had caryatids and atlantes supporting balconies or structures, mainly representing standing women or
                                muscular men. The caryatids found in ancient Roman architecture were mainly copies of the Greek ones, just like
                                in the Forum of Augustus
